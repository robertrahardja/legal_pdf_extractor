it is a declared VCC), and otherwise for the purpose of determining
the true persons who are or have been —
(a) financially interested in the success or failure (real or
apparent) of the VCC; or
(b) able to control or materially influence the policy of the
VCC.
(2) An application may be made to the Minister for an investigation
with respect to particular shares in or debentures of any VCC
(whether or not it is a declared VCC), for the purpose mentioned in
subsection (1), by —
(a) in a case other than one mentioned in paragraph (b) —
(i) not less than 200 members (excluding a subsidiary of
the VCC if the subsidiary is registered as a member);
or
(ii) members holding not less than 10% of the shares
issued (excluding shares held by a subsidiary of the
VCC under section 22(6) or (11), if any); or
(b) in a case where the shares or other matter in question relate
solely to a sub‑fund of a VCC —
(i) not less than 200 members holding shares that are
issued in respect of that sub‑fund; or
(ii) members holding not less than 10% of the shares that
are issued in respect of that sub‑fund (excluding
shares held by a subsidiary of the VCC under

(3) On an application made under subsection (2), the Minister must
appoint an inspector or inspectors to conduct an investigation, unless
the Minister is satisfied that the application is vexatious.
(4) An inspector appointed pursuant to an application made under
subsection (2) may investigate any matter which the application seeks
to have investigated, except insofar as the Minister is satisfied that it
is unreasonable for that matter to be investigated.
(5) Subject to section 5, section 243(2) and (4) of the Companies
Act 1967 applies, with the necessary modifications in relation to an
investigation under this section as it applies in relation to an
investigation under that section.
(6) The provisions of this Part applicable to an investigation into the
affairs of a declared VCC apply to an investigation under this section,
subject to the necessary modifications and the following further
modifications:
(a) a reference in this Part (including a provision of the
Companies Act 1967 applied by this Part) to an officer or
agent of a VCC or other corporation is to a person who is or
has been, or whom the inspector has reasonable cause to
believe to be or to have been —
(i) financially interested in the success or failure or the
apparent success or failure of the VCC or any other
corporation the membership of which is investigated
with that of the VCC; or
(ii) able to control or materially influence the policy of
that VCC or corporation,
(a) and a person concerned only on behalf of others; and
(b) the Minister is not bound to provide to the VCC or any
other person a copy of any report by an inspector appointed
under this section if the Minister is of the opinion that there
is good reason for not divulging the contents of the report
or any part of it, but may (if the Minister thinks fit) cause to
be kept by the Registrar a copy of the report or (as the case
may be) the parts of the report, as respects which the
Minister is not of that opinion.
