holding company, and any allotment or transfer of shares in a VCC to
its subsidiary is void.
(2) Subsection (1), insofar as it provides that any transfer of shares
in contravention of it is void, does not apply to a disposition of
book‑entry securities, but the Court, on being satisfied that a
disposition of book‑entry securities would in the absence of this
subsection be void may, on the application of the Registrar or any
other
person,
order
the
transfer
of
the
shares
acquired
in
contravention of subsection (1).
(3) Subsection (1) does not apply where the subsidiary is concerned
as personal representative, or as trustee, unless the VCC or a
subsidiary of the VCC is beneficially interested under the trust and is
not so interested only by way of security for the purposes of a
transaction entered into by it in the ordinary course of a business
(including the lending of money).
(4) This section does not prevent a subsidiary from continuing to be
a member of a VCC that is its holding company if, at the time when it
becomes a subsidiary of the VCC, it already holds shares in that VCC,
but —
(a) subject to subsection (3), the subsidiary has no right to vote
at meetings of the VCC or any class of members of the
VCC; and
(b) subject to subsections (5) and (6), the subsidiary must,
within the period of 12 months or such longer period as the
Court may allow after becoming the subsidiary of the
VCC, dispose of all of its shares in the VCC.
(5) To avoid doubt, subsection (4)(b) ceases to apply if, during the
period in that provision, the subsidiary ceases to be a subsidiary of the
VCC.
(6) Any shares in the VCC that are not disposed of in accordance
with subsection (4)(b) may, subject to subsections (12) and (13) and
sections 23 and 24, be held or continued to be held by the subsidiary.
(7) Subject to subsection (3), subsections (1), (4), (6), (9) and (11)
apply in relation to a nominee for a corporation which is a subsidiary,
as if references in those subsections to such a corporation included
references to a nominee for it.
(8) This section does not prevent the allotment of shares in a
holding company that is a VCC to a subsidiary which already
lawfully holds shares in the VCC, if the allotment is made by way of
capitalisation of reserves of the VCC and is made to all members of
the VCC on a basis which is in direct proportion to the number of
shares held by each member in the VCC.
(9) This section does not prevent the transfer of shares in a holding
company that is a VCC to a subsidiary by way of a distribution in
specie, amalgamation or scheme of arrangement but —
(a) subject to subsection (3), the subsidiary has no right to vote
at meetings of the VCC or any class of members of the
VCC; and
(b) subject to subsections (10) and (11), the subsidiary must,
within the period of 12 months or such longer period as the
Court may allow after the transfer to the subsidiary of the
shares in the VCC, dispose of all of the shares in the VCC.
(10) To avoid doubt, subsection (9)(b) ceases to apply if, during the
period mentioned in that subsection, the subsidiary ceases to be a
subsidiary of the holding company.
(11) Any shares in the VCC that are not disposed of in accordance
with subsection (9)(b) may, subject to subsections (12) and (13) and
sections 23 and 24, be held or continued to be held by the subsidiary.
(12) The VCC must, within 14 days after any change in the number
of shares in the VCC which are held by any of its subsidiaries under
subsection (6) or (11), lodge with the Registrar a notice in the
prescribed form of this change.
(13) With respect to any share mentioned in subsection (6) or
(11) —
(a) where the VCC has shares of only one class — the total
number of shares held by all its subsidiaries under
subsection (6) or (11), must not at any time exceed 10%
of the total number of shares of the VCC at that time;
(b) where the share capital of the VCC is divided into shares of
different classes — the total number of the shares of any
class held by all its subsidiaries under subsection (6) or
(11), must not at any time exceed 10% of the total number
of the shares in that class of the VCC at that time;
(c) where paragraph (a) or (b) is contravened — the VCC must
procure the disposal of the excess shares by its subsidiary,
in accordance with section 24 before the end of the period
of 6 months beginning with the day on which that
contravention occurs, or such further period as the
Registrar may allow;
(d) where the subsidiary is a wholly‑owned subsidiary of the
VCC — no dividend may be paid, and no other distribution
(whether in cash or otherwise) of the VCC’s assets
(including any distribution of assets to members on a
winding up of the VCC or any of its sub‑funds
(if applicable)) may be made, to the subsidiary in respect
of the shares mentioned in subsection (6) or (11); and
(e) where the subsidiary is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the VCC — a dividend may be paid and other distribution
(whether in cash or otherwise) of the VCC’s assets
(including any distribution of assets to members on a
winding up of the VCC or any of its sub‑funds
(if applicable)) may be made, to the subsidiary in respect
of the shares mentioned in subsection (6) or (11).
[28/2019]
(14) In subsection (13)(c), “excess shares” means such number of
the shares, held by any subsidiary under subsection (6) or (11) at the
time
in
question,
as
resulted
in
the
limit
mentioned
in
subsection (13)(a) or (b) being exceeded.
(15) Where, but for this section, a subsidiary would have been
entitled to subscribe for shares in the VCC, the VCC may, on behalf
of the subsidiary, sell the shares for which the subsidiary would
otherwise have been entitled to subscribe.
(16) For the purposes of this section, a VCC must inform the
Registrar of the occurrence of any of the following events by lodging
a notice in the prescribed form within 14 days after the date of
occurrence:
(a) where a shareholder of a VCC becomes a subsidiary of the
VCC;
(b) where shares of the VCC are held by a subsidiary of the
VCC and there is a change in the number of shares held by
the subsidiary.
