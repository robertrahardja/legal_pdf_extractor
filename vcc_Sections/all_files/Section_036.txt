(except
subsection (6)) of the Companies Act 1967 apply in relation to a
VCC as they apply in relation to a company, a company having a
share capital or a limited company (as the case may be), subject to
subsections (2) and (3) and section 5.
(2) The following provision applies in place of section 65(2) of the
Companies Act 1967 (which enables a company to reserve part of its
uncalled share capital for calling up in the event of a winding up):
“A VCC may, by special resolution of its members, or by
resolution of one or more members holding shares that
represent —
(a) at least 75%; or
(b) if the constitution of the VCC requires a greater
majority for that resolution, that greater majority,
of the total voting rights of all the members holding shares that
are issued in respect of a particular sub‑fund, determine that any
portion of its share capital which has not already been called up
is not capable of being called up except in the event and for the
purposes of the VCC or the sub‑fund (as the case may be) being
wound up, and in that event that portion of its share capital is not
capable of being called up except in such event and for such
purposes; but such resolution does not affect the rights of any
person acquired before the passing of the resolution.”.
(3) The reference to treasury shares in section 74(1A) of the
Companies Act 1967 is to shares held by a subsidiary of the VCC
under section 22(6) or (11), if any.
