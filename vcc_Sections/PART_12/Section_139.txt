there are any charges, whether created by the foreign corporate entity
or otherwise, which would have been required to be registered under
Division 8 of Part 4 of the Companies Act 1967 (as applied by
section 42) if the foreign corporate entity had been incorporated as a
VCC under this Act, there must be lodged with the Registrar in the
prescribed manner for registration, within 30 days after the date of
registration of the VCC, a statement containing the prescribed
particulars of the charge.
(2) Documents and particulars required to be lodged for registration
under subsection (1) may be lodged by the VCC concerned or by any
person interested in the documents.
(3) Where registration under subsection (1) is effected by some
person other than the VCC concerned, that person is entitled to
recover from the VCC the amount of any fees properly paid by him or
her for the registration.
(4) If subsection (1) is contravened, the VCC and every officer of
the VCC who is in default shall each be guilty of an offence and shall
each be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000, and also
to a default penalty.
(5) To avoid doubt, a failure to comply with subsection (1) does not
affect the continuity of status, operation or effect of any security,
right, priority or obligation of the charge.
(6) The Court, on being satisfied â€”
(a) that the omission to register a charge requiring registration
under subsection (1), or that the omission or misstatement
of any particular with respect to such charge, was
accidental or due to inadvertence or to some other
sufficient cause or is not of a nature to prejudice the
position of creditors or shareholders; or
(b) that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief,
may on the application of the VCC or any person interested and on
such terms and conditions as seem to the Court just and expedient
(including a term or condition that the rectification is not to affect any
liability already incurred by the VCC or any of its officers in respect
of the default) order that the time for registration be extended or that
the omission or misstatement be rectified.
(7) In respect of any charge that is required to be lodged under
subsection
(1),
sections
134,
135,
and
of
the
Companies Act 1967 (as applied by section 42) apply as if the

Act 1967 (as applied by section 42) applied.
