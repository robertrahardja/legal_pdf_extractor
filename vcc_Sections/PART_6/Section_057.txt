and
(3),
where
under
paragraph (k) of the provision that replaces section 254(1) of the
Companies Act because of section 130(8), a VCC is ordered to be
wound up by the Court on the ground that the VCC is being used for
purposes against national security or the national interest, the Court
may, on the application of the Minister, make an order (called in this
section a disqualification order) disqualifying any person who is a
director of that VCC from being a director or in any way (whether
directly or indirectly) being concerned in, or from taking part in, the
management of another VCC for a period of 3 years from the date of
the making of the winding up order.
(2) The Court must not make a disqualification order against any
person unless the Court is satisfied that the person has been given at
least 14 days’ notice of the application for the order.
(3) The Court must not make a disqualification order against any
person if the person proves to the satisfaction of the Court that —
(a) the VCC had been used for purposes against national
security or the national interest without his or her consent
or connivance; and
(b) he or she had exercised such diligence to prevent the VCC
from being so used as he or she ought to have exercised,
having regard to the nature of his or her function in that
capacity and to all the circumstances.
(4) A person who contravenes a disqualification order shall be
guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not
exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
