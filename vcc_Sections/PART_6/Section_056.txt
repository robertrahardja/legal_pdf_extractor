(a) on the application of the Minister or the Official Receiver
as
provided
for
in
section
149(9)
of
the
Companies Act 1967 as applied by subsection (11); and
(b) on being satisfied as to the matters in subsection (2),
make an order (called in this section a disqualification order), which
must not in any case exceed 5 years after the date of the
disqualification order disqualifying a person specified in the order
from being a director or in any way (whether directly or indirectly)
being concerned in, or take part in, the management of a VCC during
such period as is specified in the order.
(2) The
Court
must
make
a
disqualification
order
under
subsection (1) if the Court is satisfied that —
(a) the person is or has been a director of a VCC which has at
any time gone into liquidation (either while he or she was a
director or within 3 years of his or her ceasing to be a
director) and was insolvent at that time;
(b) the conduct of the person as director of that VCC (either
taken alone or together with his or her conduct as a director
of any other VCC or corporation) makes him or her unfit to
be a director of or in any way (whether directly or
indirectly) be concerned in, or to take part in, the
management of a VCC; and
(c) the person has been given at least 14 days’ notice of the
application.
(3) If —
(a) in the case of a person who is or has been a director of a
VCC which is being wound up by the Court, it appears to
the Official Receiver or the liquidator (if the liquidator is
not the Official Receiver); or
(b) in the case of a person who is or has been a director of a
VCC which is being wound up otherwise than as
mentioned in paragraph (a), it appears to the liquidator,
that the conditions mentioned in subsection (2)(a) and (b) are
satisfied as respects that person, the Official Receiver or the
liquidator (as the case may be) must immediately report the matter
to the Minister.
(4) The Minister may require the Official Receiver, the liquidator or
the former liquidator of the VCC —
(a) to provide the Minister with such information of any
person’s conduct as a director of the VCC; and
(b) to produce any books, papers and other records relevant to
that person’s conduct as such a director,
as the Minister may reasonably require for the purpose of determining
whether to exercise, or of exercising, any of the Minister’s functions
under this section.
(5) If any person fails to comply with a requirement of the Minister
under subsection (4), the Court may, on the application of the
Minister, make an order requiring that person to comply with the
requirement within the time specified in the order.
(6) For the purposes of this section —
(a) a VCC has gone into liquidation —
(i) if it is wound up by the Court — on the date of the
filing of the winding up application;
(ii) if a provisional liquidator was appointed under
section 291(1) of the Companies Act as applied by
section 130 — at the time when the declaration made
under that provision was lodged with the Registrar;
and
(iii) in any other case — on the date of the passing of the
resolution for the voluntary winding up;
(b) a VCC was insolvent at the time it has gone into liquidation
if it was unable to pay its debts, within the meaning of
section 254(2) of the Companies Act as applied by
section 130; and
(c) a reference to a person’s conduct as a director of any VCC
or other corporation that has become insolvent includes
that person’s conduct in relation to any matter connected
with or arising out of the insolvency of that VCC or
corporation.
(7) In deciding whether subsection (2)(b) is satisfied, the Court —
(a) must have regard generally to the matters mentioned in
subsection (8); and
(b) must have regard particularly to the matters mentioned in
subsection (9),
regardless of whether or not the director has been convicted or may be
criminally liable in respect of any of these matters.
(8) The matters to which the Court must have regard generally
are —
(a) whether there has been any misfeasance or breach of any
fiduciary or other duty by the director in relation to the
VCC;
(b) whether there has been any misapplication or retention by
the director of, or any conduct by the director giving rise to
an obligation to account for, any money or other property
of the VCC; and
(c) the extent of the director’s responsibility for any failure by
the VCC to comply with —
(i) section 138, 191 or 199 of the Companies Act 1967
as applied by section 42, 81(7) or 99, as the case may
be;
(ii) section 81(1) to (6) or 97; or
(iii) section 100, and the provisions of section 201 of the
Companies Act 1967 as applied by section 100.
(9) The matters to which the Court must have regard particularly
are —
(a) the extent of the director’s responsibility for the causes of
the VCC becoming insolvent;
(b) the extent of the director’s responsibility for any failure by
the VCC to supply any goods or services which have been
paid for (in whole or in part);
(c) the extent of the director’s responsibility for the VCC
entering into any transaction liable to be set aside under
section 259 of the Companies Act as applied by
section 130; and
(d) whether the causes of the VCC becoming insolvent are
attributable to the VCC carrying on business in a particular
industry where the risk of insolvency is generally
recognised to be higher.
(10) The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, add to, vary
or amend the matters mentioned in subsections (8) and (9) and that
notification may contain such transitional provisions as may appear
to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.
(11) Subject to section 5 and subsection (12), section 149(9), (9A),
(11) and (12) of the Companies Act 1967 applies in relation to an
application for and the making of a disqualification order under
subsection (1) and to a person disqualified by such order, as it applies
in relation to the application for and the making of a disqualification
order under section 149(1) of the Companies Act 1967 and to a
person disqualified by such order.
(12) For the purpose of subsection (11), references to a person
acting as judicial manager and to acts done in such capacity are
omitted.
(13) Subject to section 5, section 149(13) and (14) of the
Companies Act 1967 applies in relation to an application for
permission of the Court to be concerned in or take part in the
management of a VCC, as it applies in relation to an application for
permission of the Court to be concerned in or take part in the
management of a company.
