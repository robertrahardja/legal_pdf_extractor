financial year if —
(a) the directors of the VCC give written notice to the VCC’s
members, at least 60 days before the last date on which a
VCC must hold an annual general meeting under
section 77, that an annual general meeting for the
financial year will not be held; or
(b) the VCC has sent to all persons entitled to receive notice of
general meetings of the VCC the documents mentioned in
section 105(1) and (2) within the period specified in
section 105(1)(b).
(2) The notice under subsection (1) may specify more than
one financial year for which an annual general meeting will not be
held, and subsection (1) is effective for each of those years.
(3) However, subsection (1) does not affect any liability already
incurred by reason of default in holding an annual general meeting.
(4) For any financial year in which —
(a) an annual general meeting would be required to be held but
for this section; and
(b) no such meeting has been held,
one or more members of the VCC holding, or together holding, not
less than 10% of the total number of paid-up shares carrying the right
of voting at general meetings may, by notice to the VCC not later than
14 days before the date by which an annual general meeting would
have been required under section 77 to be held, require the holding of
an annual general meeting for that financial year.
(5) The power of a member under subsection (4) to require the
holding of an annual general meeting is exercisable not only by the
giving of a notice but also by the transmission to the VCC at such
address as may for the time being be specified for the purpose by or
on behalf of the VCC of an electronic communication containing the
requirement.
(6) If such a notice is given or an electronic communication is
transmitted, section 77(1) and (4) applies with respect to the calling of
the meeting and the consequences of default.
(7) Unless the contrary intention appears, if a VCC need not hold an
annual general meeting for a financial year then, for that financial
year —
(a) a reference in a provision of this Act (including a provision
of the Companies Act 1967 as applied by this Act) to the
doing of anything at an annual general meeting is to the
doing of that thing by way of a resolution by written means
under section 184A of the Companies Act 1967 as applied
by section 80(3);
(b) a reference in a provision of this Act (including a provision
of the Companies Act 1967 as applied by this Act) to the
date or conclusion of an annual general meeting is, unless
the meeting is held, to the date of expiry of the period
within which an annual general meeting is required under
section 77 to be held; and
(c) the reference in section 97(1) to the lodging of a return with
the Registrar after its annual general meeting is to the
lodging of that return after the VCC has sent to all persons
entitled to receive notice of general meetings of the VCC
the documents mentioned in section 105(1) and (2).
(8) In this section, an address of a person includes any number or
address used for electronic communication.
