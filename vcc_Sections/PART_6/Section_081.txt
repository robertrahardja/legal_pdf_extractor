it —
(a) the name and address of each member;
(b) a
statement
of
the
shares
held
by
each
member,
distinguishing each share by its number (if any) or by
the number (if any) of the certificate (if any) evidencing the
member’s holding;
(c) the name and registration number of the sub‑fund, and
share class (if applicable) to which the shares held by each
member relates;
(d) the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on the
shares of each member;
(e) the date at which the name of each person was entered in
the register as a member;
(f) the date at which any person who ceased to be a member
during the previous 7 years so ceased to be a member; and
(g) the date of every allotment of shares to members and the
number of shares comprised in each allotment.
(2) Despite subsection (1), a VCC may keep the names and
particulars relating to persons who have ceased to be members of the
VCC separately, and the names and particulars relating to former
members need not be supplied to any person who applies for a copy of
the register unless that person specifically requests the names and
particulars of former members.
(3) The register of members is prima facie evidence of any matter
required or authorised by this Act to be included in it.
(4) Every VCC having more than 50 members must —
(a) unless the register of members is in such a form as to
constitute in itself an index, keep an index in convenient
form of the names of the members; and
(b) within 14 days after the date on which any alteration is
made in the register of members, make any necessary
alteration to the index.
(5) The index must, in respect of each member, contain a sufficient
indication to enable the account of that member in the register to be
readily found.
(6) If subsection (1), (4) or (5) is contravened, the VCC and every
officer of the VCC who is in default shall each be guilty of an offence
and shall each be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000,
and also to a default penalty.
(7) Sections 191 and 194 of the Companies Act 1967 apply in
relation to the register of members and index of a VCC, as they apply
in relation to the register of members and index of a public company,
subject to section 5 and subsection (8).
(8) In addition to the grounds in section 194(1) of the Companies
Act 1967, an application under that provision may be made to the
Court for any default in entering in the register of members any
information in subsection (1) concerning shares held by a person.
(9) Despite section 194 of the Companies Act 1967 as applied by
subsection (7), a VCC may, without an application to the Court, at any
time rectify any error or omission in the register of members
(including any overstatement or understatement of the VCC’s issued
share capital), but only if —
(a) the rectification does not adversely affect any person; or
(b) the person so adversely affected agrees to the rectification.
(10) Where —
(a) by reason of section 191(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1967
as applied by subsection (7), the register of members is
kept at the office of some person other than the VCC; and
(b) by reason of any default of that other person, the VCC
contravenes
section
191(1)
or
(2)
of
the
Companies Act 1967 as applied by subsection (7),
section 82(1), (2) or (3), or any requirement of this Act
as to the production of the register,
then that other person shall be liable to the same penalties for such
contravention as if the person were an officer of the VCC who was in
default, and the power of the Court under section 399 of the
Companies Act 1967 (as applied by section 160) extends to making
an order against that other person as well as the person’s officers and
employees.
(11) Subject to section 5, section 195 of the Companies Act 1967
applies in relation to shares in a VCC as it applies in relation to shares
in a company.
