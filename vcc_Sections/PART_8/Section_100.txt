for each sub‑fund that are prepared using the same
Accounting Standards as those used to prepare the
accounts of the VCC.
(3) The directors of a VCC that is a parent company at the end of its
financial year need not comply with subsection (1), but must cause to
be made out and laid before the VCC at its annual general meeting —
(a) consolidated
financial
statements
dealing
with
the
financial position and performance of the group for the
financial year in respect of which the annual general
meeting is held; and
(b) a balance sheet dealing with the state of affairs of the VCC
and its sub‑funds (if any) at the end of its financial year.
(4) Subject to section 201(12), (13) and (14) of the Companies
Act 1967 as applied by subsection (6), the consolidated financial
statements
in
subsection
(3)(a)
and
the
balance
sheet
in
subsection (3)(b) must —
(a) comply with the requirements of the Accounting Standards
and give a true and fair view of the matters mentioned in
subsection (3)(a) and (b) (respectively), so far as they
concern members of the VCC; and
(b) if the VCC is an umbrella VCC, contain separate accounts
for each sub‑fund that are prepared using the same

accounts of the VCC.
(5) Before the financial statements in subsection (1) and the balance
sheet in subsection (3)(b) are made out, the directors of the VCC must
take reasonable steps —
(a) to ascertain what action has been taken in relation to the
writing off of bad debts and the making of provisions for
doubtful debts, and to cause all known bad debts to be
written off and adequate provision to be made for doubtful
debts;
(b) to ascertain whether any current assets (other than current
assets to which paragraph (a) applies) are unlikely to
realise in the ordinary course of business their value as
shown in the accounting records of the VCC or its
sub‑funds (if any) and, if so, to cause —
(i) those assets to be written down to an amount which
they might be expected so to realise; or
(ii) adequate provision to be made for the difference
between the amount of the value as so shown and the
amount that they might be expected so to realise; and
(c) to ascertain whether any non-current asset is shown in the
books of the VCC or its sub‑funds (if any) at an amount
which, having regard to its value to the VCC or the
sub‑fund (as the case may be) as a going concern, exceeds
the amount which would be recoverable over its useful life
or on its disposal and (unless adequate provision for
writing down that asset is made) to cause to be included in
the financial statements such information and explanations
as will prevent the financial statements from being
misleading by reason of the overstatement of the amount
of that asset.
